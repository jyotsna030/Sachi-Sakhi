          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Understanding Postpartum Depression</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Postpartum depression is a form of clinical depression that can occur in the weeks or months following childbirth. Unlike the temporary "baby blues" that resolve within a few days, PPD can persist and interfere with daily life. It is essential to differentiate between the two to ensure that appropriate care and support are provided.
