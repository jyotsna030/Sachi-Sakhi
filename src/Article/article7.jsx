            Menopause is a natural transition in a womanâ€™s life that marks the end of menstrual cycles. While it often brings physical and emotional changes, understanding the process and adopting effective coping strategies can make this journey empowering rather than daunting. Here, we explore the stages of menopause, common symptoms, and tips for navigating this phase with confidence.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800">Understanding Menopause</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            Menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, with the average age being 51. It is defined as the cessation of menstruation for 12 consecutive months. The transition to menopause, known as perimenopause, can last several years and is characterized by hormonal fluctuations. Postmenopause refers to the years following menopause, during which symptoms may persist but often diminish over time. During this period, women may also experience an increased risk of certain health conditions, such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular issues, making proactive care essential.
